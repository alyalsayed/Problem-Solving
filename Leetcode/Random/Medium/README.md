# LeetCode

Welcome to our LeetCode website! This is a platform where you can practice and improve your coding skills by solving algorithmic problems.

## Getting Started

To use our platform, you will need to create an account and sign in. Once you are logged in, you can access our collection of problems and start solving them.

## Problems

The platform has a large collection of algorithmic problems that cover a wide range of topics and difficulty levels. You can search for problems by keyword or by topic, and filter them by difficulty level.

Each problem comes with a detailed problem statement, sample inputs and outputs, and a discussion forum where you can ask questions and discuss the problem with other users.

## Submitting Solutions

To solve a problem, you will need to write a solution in one of our supported programming languages (currently, we support Python, Java, and C++). Once you have written your solution, you can submit it to our platform and we will run it against a set of test cases to check if it is correct.

If your solution passes all the test cases, you will receive a "Accepted" verdict, and your solution will be added to our database of correct solutions. If your solution fails any of the test cases, you will receive a "Wrong Answer" verdict, and you can try again to fix your solution.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to our platform, you can do so by submitting your own problems or solutions. We welcome contributions from users of all levels and backgrounds, and we are committed to making our platform a welcoming and inclusive community for everyone.

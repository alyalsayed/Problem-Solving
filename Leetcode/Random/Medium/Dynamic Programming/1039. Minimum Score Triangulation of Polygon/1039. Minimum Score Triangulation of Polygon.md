The Minimum Score Triangulation Problem is the problem of finding the minimum possible score of a triangulation of a given polygon. There are several approaches to solving this problem, including dynamic programming and recursion with memoization.

## Dynamic Programming Approach

In the dynamic programming approach, we create a 2D array to store the minimum score of triangulation for each sub-polygon. We start by dividing the polygon into sub-polygons with two vertices, and compute the minimum score of triangulation for each of these sub-polygons. We then use these results to compute the minimum score of triangulation for sub-polygons with three vertices, and so on, until we compute the minimum score of triangulation for the entire polygon.

The time complexity of this approach is O(n^3), where n is the number of vertices in the polygon, and the space complexity is O(n^2).

## Recursion with Memoization Approach

In the recursion with memoization approach, we define a recursive function that calculates the minimum score of triangulation for the sub-polygon with vertices from i to j. The function checks if the result for this sub-polygon is already memoized, and if so, returns the memoized result. Otherwise, it tries all possible values of k between i+1 and j-1 as the last vertex in a triangle, and recursively calculates the minimum score of triangulation for the sub-polygon on the left and the sub-polygon on the right of the triangle. The function then adds the score of the triangle formed by vertices i, k, and j to get the total score of triangulation for the sub-polygon with vertices from i to j, and memoizes this result for future use.

The time complexity of this approach is also O(n^3), but the space complexity is O(n^2) due to the memoization.

## Conclusion

Both the dynamic programming approach and the recursion with memoization approach can be used to solve the Minimum Score Triangulation Problem. The dynamic programming approach has a higher space complexity but can be more efficient in some cases. The recursion with memoization approach has a lower space complexity but can be slower in some cases. The choice of approach depends on the specific requirements of the problem and the resources available.

Here's some Python code for both approaches:

### Dynamic Programming Approach

```python
class Solution:
    def minScoreTriangulation(self, values: List[int]) -> int:
          
        n = len(values)
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
        
        for gap in range(2, n):
            for i in range(n - gap):
                j = i + gap
                dp[i][j] = float('inf')
                for k in range(i + 1, j):
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + values[i] * values[k] * values[j])
                    
        return dp[0][n - 1]
```
### Recursion with Memoization Approach

```python
class Solution:
    def minScoreTriangulation(self, values: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(values)
        memo = [[-1] * n for _ in range(n)]
        
        def dp(i, j):
            if j - i < 2:
                return 0
            if memo[i][j] != -1:
                return memo[i][j]
            res = float('inf')
            for k in range(i+1, j):
                res = min(res, dp(i, k) + dp(k, j) + values[i]*values[k]*values[j])
            memo[i][j] = res
            return res
        
        return dp(0, n-1)
